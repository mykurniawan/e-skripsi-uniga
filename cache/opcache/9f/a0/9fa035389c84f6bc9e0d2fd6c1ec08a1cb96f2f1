<p>OJS has currently only been tested on MySQL and PostgreSQL, although other database management systems supported by <a href="https://adodb.org" target="_blank">ADOdb</a> may work (in full or partially). Compatibility reports and/or code patches for alternative DBMSs can be sent to the OJS team.</p>
